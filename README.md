# Monte Carlo Stock Forecasting Project

This repository contains implementations of stock forecasting models and strategies in Python. The project is organized into two main folders:

1. **Monte Carlo Forecast Folder**
   - `MC_Main.py`: Contains the implementation of the Monte Carlo forecasting model.
   - `MC_Functions.ipynb`: Contains the functions required to implement the Monte Carlo forecasting model.
   - `Price_Paths.ipynb`: Contains the introductory project to first calculate the daily price changes using the geometric Brownian motion formula, then compute the price at each time step based on the previous price and the corresponding daily return

   The Monte Carlo forecast uses random sampling techniques to simulate various future scenarios based on historical data. Project followed: https://        medium.com/analytics-vidhya/monte-carlo-simulations-for-predicting-stock-prices-python-a64f53585662
